As a project owner
I want to create the project docs
So that the docs can inform future development

---

Here are the docs we currently have in mind:

- Architecture.md
- Design.md
- Plan.md
- Project.md
- Requirements.md
- Roadmap.md
- Specification.md

Keep this list in mind as we are going to work through each doc one by one. 

We want to start with the Project.md file. Please review the attached docs and feel free to scan the workspace for additional context to create a Project.md file that defines our project from a developer perspective and helps future developer, whether they be human or AI.
