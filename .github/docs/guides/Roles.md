# Role Collaboration Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This document defines how the five core roles in our development methodology collaborate to create exceptional Alpine.js standalone applications. Each role has specific responsibilities, clear interfaces, and defined collaboration patterns that ensure quality, efficiency, and user satisfaction.

## 🏗️ Role System Architecture

### **Complete Role Ecosystem**
```
           Product-Owner (Strategy & Vision)
                      ↙        ↘
          Architect (Blueprint) ←→ Designer (Experience)
                ↓                        ↓
           Developer (Implementation) ←→ QA-Engineer (Validation)
```

### **Role Hierarchy and Dependencies**
```
Strategic Level:    Product-Owner
                         ↓
Specification Level: Architect ←→ Designer  
                         ↓           ↓
Implementation Level: Developer ←→ QA-Engineer
```

## 🔄 Core Collaboration Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Project Initiation Flow**
```
1. Product-Owner → Defines vision, requirements, and success criteria
2. Architect → Creates technical blueprint and system design
3. Designer → Develops UI/UX specifications aligned with architecture
4. Developer → Implements Alpine.js code following both specs
5. QA-Engineer → Validates against all role requirements
```

### **Pattern 2: Feature Development Cycle**
```
Product-Owner: "We need offline recipe filtering"
        ↓
Architect: "Single-page Alpine.js reactive filter with localStorage"
        ↓
Designer: "Mobile-first filter UI with clear visual feedback"
        ↓
Developer: "Implements x-data reactive filtering with Tailwind CSS"
        ↓
QA-Engineer: "Tests offline functionality and mobile responsiveness"
        ↓
Product-Owner: "Validates user value and business impact"
```

### **Pattern 3: Quality Feedback Loop**
```
QA-Engineer finds issue → Developer fixes → Architect reviews design impact
                                              ↓
                     Designer adjusts UX ← QA-Engineer retests
                                              ↓
                                    Product-Owner approves
```
