# Documentation Creation Order & Dependencies Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide establishes the optimal order for creating project documentation to ensure each document builds logically on the previous ones, minimizing rework and ensuring consistency across all project documentation.

## 🏗️ Three-Phase Approach

### **Phase 1: Foundation Documents**
*Establish core project understanding and requirements*

### **Phase 2: Design & Implementation** 
*Define technical architecture and detailed specifications*

### **Phase 3: Execution Planning**
*Plan development approach and future roadmap*

## 📚 Standard Document Creation Order

### **Phase 1: Foundation Documents**

#### 1. **Project.md** *(First - Always)*
- **Purpose**: Establish project vision, mission, and scope
- **Dependencies**: None (starting point)
- **Feeds into**: All other documents
- **Key Content**: Mission, goals, target users, success metrics

#### 2. **Requirements.md** *(Second - Critical Foundation)*
- **Purpose**: Define what we're building before how we build it
- **Dependencies**: Project.md
- **Feeds into**: Architecture, Design, Specification
- **Key Content**: Functional requirements, constraints, acceptance criteria

#### 3. **Architecture.md** *(Third)*
- **Purpose**: Define technical approach and system design
- **Dependencies**: Project.md, Requirements.md
- **Feeds into**: Design, Specification, Plan
- **Key Content**: Technical stack, patterns, system structure

### **Phase 2: Design & Implementation**

#### 4. **Design.md** *(Fourth)*
- **Purpose**: Define user experience and interface patterns
- **Dependencies**: Project.md, Requirements.md, Architecture.md
- **Feeds into**: Specification, Plan
- **Key Content**: UI/UX guidelines, design system, user flows

#### 5. **Specification.md** *(Fifth)*
- **Purpose**: Detailed technical implementation standards
- **Dependencies**: Requirements, Architecture, Design
- **Feeds into**: Plan (implementation approach)
- **Key Content**: Code standards, API specs, implementation details

### **Phase 3: Execution Planning**

#### 6. **Plan.md** *(Sixth)*
- **Purpose**: Define development approach and execution strategy
- **Dependencies**: All Phase 1 & 2 documents
- **Feeds into**: Roadmap
- **Key Content**: Development phases, testing strategy, delivery approach

#### 7. **Roadmap.md** *(Last)*
- **Purpose**: Define timeline and future evolution
- **Dependencies**: All other documents
- **Feeds into**: Future planning cycles
- **Key Content**: Feature timeline, milestones, long-term vision

## ⚡ Quick Decision Matrix

**When starting a new project documentation set:**

| Document | Start When | Key Question |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Project.md | Day 1 | "What are we building and why?" |
| Requirements.md | Project vision clear | "What exactly must this do?" |
| Architecture.md | Requirements defined | "How will we technically achieve this?" |
| Design.md | Architecture decided | "How will users interact with this?" |
| Specification.md | Design patterns set | "What are the exact implementation rules?" |
| Plan.md | Implementation details clear | "How will we execute this?" |
| Roadmap.md | Current scope planned | "What comes next?" |

## 🎯 Phase-by-Phase Benefits

### **Phase 1 Benefits**
- ✅ Clear project foundation before technical decisions
- ✅ Requirements drive architecture (not vice versa)  
- ✅ Prevents over-engineering by establishing real needs

### **Phase 2 Benefits**
- ✅ Design decisions informed by technical constraints
- ✅ Specifications grounded in both user needs and technical reality
- ✅ Implementation standards that support actual requirements

### **Phase 3 Benefits**
- ✅ Realistic planning based on complete technical picture
- ✅ Roadmap aligned with project capabilities and constraints
- ✅ Future planning considers current implementation approach

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ **Architecture-First Trap**
- Starting with Architecture.md before Requirements.md
- **Problem**: Technical solutions seeking problems
- **Result**: Over-engineered solutions that miss user needs

### ❌ **Specification Before Design**
- Writing detailed specs before UI/UX decisions
- **Problem**: Technical implementation without user context
- **Result**: Technically correct but unusable solutions

### ❌ **Planning Without Foundation**
- Creating roadmaps before understanding requirements
- **Problem**: Timeline commitments without scope clarity
- **Result**: Unrealistic expectations and scope creep

## 🔄 Iteration Strategy

### **Single Document Updates**
When updating a single document, consider impact on dependent documents:
- **Requirements change** → Review Architecture, Design, Specification
- **Architecture change** → Review Design, Specification, Plan
- **Design change** → Review Specification, Plan

### **Major Revision Cycles**
For significant project changes:
1. Start with Project.md updates
2. Cascade changes through dependency chain
3. Update all dependent documents before moving to next phase
4. Validate consistency across entire documentation set

## 🎨 Customization for Different Project Types

### **Software Projects**
- Standard order works perfectly
- Emphasize Architecture.md technical depth
- Specification.md covers coding standards

### **Process/Workflow Projects**  
- Requirements.md → Process flows
- Architecture.md → System interactions
- Design.md → User experience workflows

### **Research Projects**
- Requirements.md → Research questions
- Architecture.md → Methodology
- Design.md → Experiment design

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Better to have complete Phase 1 than incomplete all phases
2. **Validate Early**: Get stakeholder buy-in on each phase before proceeding  
3. **Stay Flexible**: This order optimizes for most cases, but adapt when needed
4. **Document Decisions**: Note when you deviate from this order and why
5. **Review Regularly**: Ensure earlier documents still reflect current understanding

**Remember**: The goal is logical progression that minimizes rework and maximizes consistency. This order ensures each document builds on solid foundations from the previous ones.
