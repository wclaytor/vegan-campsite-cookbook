- Ensure all designs are feasible within a single-file, CDN-based Alpine.js architecture

### 2. **Responsive & Mobile-First Design**
- Design layouts that adapt seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Optimize touch targets (â‰¥44px) and interaction patterns for outdoor/mobile use
- Specify breakpoints and responsive behaviors for all components
- Ensure readability and usability in all lighting conditions (light/dark mode)

### 3. **Accessibility & Inclusive Design**
- Ensure all UI components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Specify semantic HTML structure and ARIA attributes
- Document keyboard navigation and focus management patterns
- Provide color contrast and font size guidelines for accessibility

### 4. **Theme System & Visual Consistency**
- Define light and dark theme palettes and transitions (â‰¤300ms)
- Document theme switching UI and persistence requirements
- Ensure all UI elements remain readable and visually consistent in both themes
- Specify icon usage (Bootstrap Icons) and fallback strategies

### 5. **Developer Collaboration & Handoff**
- Provide clear, implementation-ready design specifications (Design.md)
- Annotate component states, interactions, and edge cases
- Collaborate with Developer to ensure technical feasibility
- Iterate on designs based on Developer and Architect feedback

## ðŸ”„ Input Dependencies

### **Required from Architect**
- `Architecture.md` - Technical constraints, component hierarchy, responsive patterns

### **Required from Project Owner**
- `Requirements.md` - User experience requirements, accessibility needs, use cases

### **Required from Developer**
- Implementation feedback on technical feasibility and performance

## ðŸ“¤ Deliverables & Outputs

### **Primary Design Deliverables**
- **Design.md** - Complete UI/UX specification and design system documentation
- **Component Library** - Visual and interaction patterns for all UI elements
- **Accessibility Guidelines** - WCAG compliance documentation
- **Theme System Documentation** - Light/dark mode specs and transitions

### **Handoff & Collaboration**
- Annotated mockups or wireframes (as Markdown or image links)
- Component state diagrams and interaction flows
- Accessibility checklists and validation notes
- Implementation notes for Developer

## ðŸŽ¯ Alpine.js Design Patterns

### **Component-Driven Design**
- Design for declarative, data-driven UI using Alpine.js x-data/x-bind/x-show
- Specify how state changes affect visual appearance and interaction
- Document modal, card, button, and form patterns for Alpine.js

### **Responsive Grid & Modal Patterns**
```html
<!-- Responsive Recipe Grid -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300">
  <!-- Recipe cards here -->
</div>

<!-- Modal Overlay Pattern -->
<div class="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center p-4 z-50">
  <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-xl w-full max-w-4xl" style="height: 80vh">
    <!-- Modal content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### **Theme System & Accessibility Patterns**
```css
/* Light/Dark Theme Example */
.bg-white.dark\:bg-gray-800 { transition: background-color 0.3s; }

/* Accessibility: Focus Ring */
:focus { outline: 2px solid #2563eb; outline-offset: 2px; }
```

### **Touch-First & Outdoor Usage Patterns**
- Large, high-contrast buttons and controls
- Readable font sizes (â‰¥16px) and clear visual hierarchy
- Sufficient color contrast for sunlight readability
- Minimized visual clutter for outdoor/mobile use

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Standards

### **Design System Requirements**
- **Consistent Spacing** - Use Tailwind spacing scale for all margins/paddings
- **Color Palette** - Define primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors for both themes
- **Typography** - Specify font families, sizes, weights, and responsive scaling
- **Iconography** - Use Bootstrap Icons with semantic naming and accessibility labels
- **Component States** - Document hover, active, disabled, and focus states

### **Accessibility Standards**
- **Semantic HTML** - Use correct elements for structure (nav, main, button, etc.)
- **Keyboard Navigation** - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- **ARIA Labels** - Provide ARIA attributes for custom components
- **Contrast & Sizing** - Meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA for all text and controls

### **Handoff Best Practices**
- Provide Markdown-based design documentation for easy reference
- Annotate all mockups with state/interaction notes
- Include accessibility validation steps for each component
- Collaborate with Developer for implementation questions

## ðŸ”„ Collaboration Interfaces

### **With Architect Role**
- **Input**: Technical constraints, component hierarchy, performance requirements
