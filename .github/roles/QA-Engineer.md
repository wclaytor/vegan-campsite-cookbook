## ðŸ§ª Alpine.js Testing Patterns

### **Reactive Component Testing**
```javascript
// Testing Alpine.js State Management
function testRecipeFiltering() {
    // Setup test data
    const testApp = cookbookApp();
    testApp.recipes = [
        { title: "Test Recipe 1", categories: ["main"], ingredients: "tofu, rice" },
        { title: "Test Recipe 2", categories: ["appetizer"], ingredients: "nuts, bread" }
    ];
    
    // Test search functionality
    testApp.searchTerm = "tofu";
    const filtered = testApp.filteredRecipes;
    
    // Validate results
    assert(filtered.length === 1, "Search should return 1 result");
    assert(filtered[0].title === "Test Recipe 1", "Should return correct recipe");
}
```

### **Standalone Application Testing Strategy**
```javascript
// File Protocol Testing (True Offline)
async function testOfflineFunctionality() {
    // Test 1: Load via file:// protocol
    const fileUrl = "file:///path/to/index.html";
    
    // Test 2: Validate CDN fallbacks work
    await testCDNFallbacks();
    
    // Test 3: Ensure localStorage persistence
    await testLocalStoragePersistence();
    
    // Test 4: Validate graceful degradation
    await testNetworkFailureScenarios();
}
```

### **Performance Testing Patterns**
```javascript
// Mobile Performance Benchmarking
async function benchmarkMobilePerformance() {
    // Test load times
    const loadStart = performance.now();
    await loadApplication();
    const loadTime = performance.now() - loadStart;
    
    // Test search responsiveness
    const searchStart = performance.now();
    performSearch("recipe query");
    const searchTime = performance.now() - searchStart;
    
    // Validate performance criteria
    assert(loadTime < 2000, "App should load in under 2 seconds");
    assert(searchTime < 100, "Search should be instantaneous");
}
```
