## Ingredients
### For the Protein Base:
- 1½ cups TVP (textured vegetable protein) chunks OR 1 lb extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 2 cups vegetable broth (if using TVP)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (if using tofu)

### For the Curry Spice Blend:
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ¼ teaspoon mustard seeds, ground (or ¼ teaspoon ground mustard)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper

### For the Salad:
- ⅓ cup vegan mayonnaise (store-bought or homemade)
- 1 medium carrot, finely shredded
- ⅓ cup golden raisins
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 green onions, finely chopped (optional)
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

### For Homemade Vegan Mayo (Optional):
- ½ cup unsweetened soy milk
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup neutral oil (like sunflower or avocado)

## Steps
### If Making Homemade Mayo:
1. **Make the mayo:** In a tall, narrow container, combine soy milk, vinegar, mustard, and salt. Using an immersion blender, blend while slowly drizzling in oil until thick and creamy (about 2-3 minutes). Set aside.

### For TVP Version:
2. **Prepare TVP:** Bring vegetable broth to a boil. Add TVP chunks and simmer for 10 minutes until tender. Drain well and let cool completely.

### For Tofu Version:
2. **Prepare tofu:** Press tofu to remove excess water, then cube into bite-sized pieces. Heat olive oil in a large skillet and sauté tofu until golden on all sides. Let cool completely, then crumble into chunky pieces.

### Assembly:
3. **Toast spices:** In a dry skillet, toast curry powder, turmeric, and mustard seeds for 30 seconds until fragrant. Remove from heat and stir in salt and pepper.

4. **Season protein:** Toss the cooled TVP or crumbled tofu with the toasted spice blend, mixing well to coat evenly.

5. **Make the salad:** In a large bowl, whisk together vegan mayo, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard. Add the spiced protein, shredded carrots, and raisins. Fold gently to combine without mashing.

6. **Finish and chill:** Stir in green onions and cilantro if using. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or lemon juice. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let flavors meld.

## Serving Guidelines
- Serve chilled on whole grain bread, in pita pockets, or wrapped in tortillas
- Excellent over mixed greens or as a stuffing for avocado halves
- Great for picnics and potlucks - holds well for several hours

## Notes
- **Texture tip:** Don't over-mix - you want distinct chunks of protein, not a mushy paste
- **Color enhancement:** Extra turmeric gives a more vibrant yellow color
- **Spice level:** Add a pinch of cayenne for heat, or curry paste for deeper flavor
- **Make-ahead:** Best after chilling for a few hours; flavors improve overnight
- **Storage:** Keeps in refrigerator for up to 4 days

## Camping Notes
- **Equipment needed:** Large mixing bowl, skillet for toasting spices
- **Make-ahead friendly:** Prepare completely at home, pack in cooler
- **Storage:** Keeps well on ice for 2-3 days
- **Serving ideas:** Pre-make sandwiches or bring bread/wraps for assembly at campsite
- **No-cook option:** Use pre-seasoned baked tofu to skip the cooking step
