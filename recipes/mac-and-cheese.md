## Ingredients
- 12 oz elbow macaroni (or other short pasta)
- 1 cup raw cashews (soaked in hot water for 20 minutes)
- 1 ½ cups unsweetened almond milk (or oat milk)
- ½ cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp white miso paste (optional, for umami)
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- ½ tsp turmeric (for color)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- ½ cup panko breadcrumbs (optional topping)
- 1 tbsp vegan butter or olive oil (for toasting breadcrumbs)

## Steps  
1. Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.  
2. While pasta cooks, drain soaked cashews.  
3. In a blender, combine cashews, almond milk, nutritional yeast, olive oil, lemon juice, miso paste, garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Blend until silky smooth.  
4. Pour the sauce into a saucepan and heat gently over medium heat, stirring until thickened (about 5 minutes). Adjust seasoning to taste.  
5. Toss the cooked pasta with the sauce until well coated.  
6. (Optional) For a baked version: transfer mac and cheese to a casserole dish, top with panko breadcrumbs toasted in vegan butter or olive oil, and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 15 minutes until golden.  

## Serving Guidelines
- Serve warm, topped with fresh parsley or a sprinkle of smoked paprika.  
- Great with a side salad or roasted vegetables.  

## Notes  
- For nut-free: substitute sunflower seeds or use a store-bought vegan cheese sauce.  
- Add steamed broccoli, peas, or spinach for extra nutrition.  
- For a spicy kick, add cayenne or hot sauce to the sauce.
