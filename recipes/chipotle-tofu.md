## Ingredients

### For the Tofu:
- 18 oz extra-firm tofu
- ¾ cup diced white onion (optional)
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### For the Sofritas Sauce:
- 1 tbsp minced garlic (about 3-4 cloves)
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo (more if you like it spicy)
- 3 tbsp chipotle adobo sauce
- 1½ cups vegetable broth (low-sodium)
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp maple syrup (optional, for balance)
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 tbsp lime juice (or lemon juice)

### For Garnish:
- Chopped fresh cilantro
- Lime wedges

## Steps

1. **Prepare the sauce:** Add garlic, chipotle pepper in adobo, chipotle adobo sauce, vegetable broth, tomato paste, ground cumin, oregano, paprika, maple syrup, salt, and lime juice to a blender. Blend until completely smooth.

2. **Prepare the tofu:** Place the extra-firm tofu in a large mixing bowl and use a potato masher or wooden spoon to break the tofu into small, mince-like pieces. (For safety, do not break the tofu directly in the pan while cooking.)

3. **Cook the tofu:** Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the crumbled tofu and diced onion (if using) to the skillet. Stir constantly to prevent burning, scraping the bottom of the skillet if anything starts to stick.

4. **Brown the tofu:** Continue cooking the tofu until it becomes golden and crispy on the outside, approximately 10 minutes.

5. **Add the sauce:** Pour the Sofritas sauce over the tofu and mix thoroughly to combine.

6. **Simmer:** Reduce heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust salt if needed.

## Serving Guidelines

Serve the Sofritas hot with your choice of:

- **Burrito Bowl:** Over cilantro lime rice or plain rice, topped with corn, salsa, avocado, black beans, lettuce, fresh tomatoes, chopped cilantro, and freshly squeezed lime juice
- **Burritos:** Wrapped in tortillas with fruit salsa and vegan cheese, browned on the outside
- **Tacos:** In tortillas with shredded lettuce, crunchy slaw, chopped onion, tomatoes, and dairy-free sour cream
- **As a dip:** With chips or cornbread muffins

## Notes

### Storage:
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days
- Freeze in an airtight container for up to 2 months (texture may become slightly chewier)
- Always thaw frozen Sofritas in the refrigerator (not at room temperature) for food safety
- Gluten-Free (check vegetable broth label)

### Tips:
- For extra-firm texture, you can freeze the tofu overnight, then thaw and press before use
- Brown the tofu crumbles in the oven or air fryer first to reduce oil if desired
- Adjust the number of chipotle peppers based on your spice preference (1 for mild, 3+ for very spicy)
- The maple syrup helps balance the spicy and sour flavors - don't skip it unless you prefer a more intense flavor

### Variations:
- Add poblano peppers for extra heat
- Use yellow onions instead of white onions
- Try with different beans (pinto beans work great too)
