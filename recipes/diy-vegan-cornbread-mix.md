## Ingredients
### For the Cornbread Mix (Make at Home):

- 1 cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour blend)
- 1/4 cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
- 2 tablespoons powdered coconut milk or cashew powder (optional, for richness)

### To Make Cornbread at Camp:
- 1 batch cornbread mix (above)
- 1 cup water
- 1/4 cup neutral oil (sunflower, avocado, or melted coconut oil)
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or lemon juice

### Optional Add-ins:
- 1/2 cup corn kernels (fresh, frozen, or canned and drained)
- 1/4 cup diced jalapeños for spice
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (chives, cilantro)

## Steps
### At Home - Make the Mix:
1. **Combine dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, ground flaxseed, and powdered coconut milk until well combined.

2. **Store properly:** Transfer to an airtight container or resealable bag. Label with cooking instructions and date. Mix keeps for 6+ months at room temperature.

3. **Optional portioning:** Divide into individual recipe portions if making multiple camping trips.

### At Camp - Make the Cornbread:

#### Oven/Camp Oven Method:
4. **Preheat:** Heat oven to 400°F, or prepare camp oven with coals (about 16-18 coals on top, 8-10 underneath for 400°F).

5. **Mix batter:** In a bowl, combine water, oil, and vinegar. Add cornbread mix and stir just until combined - don't overmix. Fold in any optional add-ins.

6. **Prepare pan:** Grease an 8x8 pan or muffin tin. Pour in batter and spread evenly.

7. **Bake:** 20-25 minutes for pan, 15-18 minutes for muffins, until golden and toothpick comes out clean.

#### Campfire Skillet Method:
4. **Heat skillet:** Use a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Heat over medium coals with lid nearby.

5. **Mix and pour:** Prepare batter as above. Pour into hot, greased skillet.

6. **Cover and cook:** Place lid on skillet, arrange coals on top (more on top than bottom for even cooking). Cook 20-25 minutes until set.

#### Microwave Method (Emergency):
4. **Mix batter:** Prepare as above but use only 3/4 cup water for thicker consistency.

5. **Microwave-safe dish:** Pour into greased microwave-safe 8x8 dish or divide among microwave-safe mugs.

6. **Cook:** Microwave on 70% power for 5-7 minutes for full pan, 2-3 minutes for individual mugs. Check with toothpick.

## Serving Guidelines
- Serve warm with vegan butter, honey substitute, or jam
- Excellent alongside chili, soup, or BBQ
- Great for breakfast with maple syrup or as dinner bread

## Notes
- **Texture tip:** Don't overmix the batter - lumps are okay and create tender cornbread
- **Moisture boost:** The flaxseed and coconut powder add richness without needing eggs or milk
- **Sweetness level:** Adjust sugar in mix to taste - Southern style is less sweet, Northern style is sweeter
- **Storage:** Baked cornbread keeps 2-3 days wrapped, or freeze for longer storage
- **Altitude adjustment:** At high altitude, reduce baking powder by 1/4 teaspoon

## Camping Notes
- **Equipment needed:** Mixing bowl, whisk, 8x8 pan or muffin tin OR cast iron skillet with lid
- **Coal management:** For Dutch oven, use 2:1 ratio top to bottom coals
- **No-oil version:** Can substitute 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for oil (slightly denser result)
- **Water source:** Any clean water works - no special requirements
- **Make-ahead:** Mix can be pre-combined with water in sealed container, cook within 30 minutes

## Variations
### Jalapeño Corn Muffins:
- Add 1/4 cup diced jalapeños and 1/4 cup corn kernels to batter

### Sweet Breakfast Version:
- Increase sugar to 1/3 cup in mix
- Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract with wet ingredients

### Herb Cornbread:
- Add 2 tablespoons dried herbs (rosemary, thyme, sage) to mix

### Cheesy Style:
- Add 1/4 cup nutritional yeast to mix for cheesy flavor

## Camping Cooking Tips
### Dutch Oven Method:
- **Coal placement:** 16-18 coals on top, 8-10 underneath for 400°F
- **Rotation:** Rotate pot 1/4 turn every 10 minutes for even cooking
- **Done test:** Golden brown top, pulls slightly from sides

### Cast Iron Skillet:
- **Heat management:** Start with medium heat, reduce if browning too fast
- **Lid coals:** Place 8-10 coals on lid for top browning
- **Steam release:** Crack lid slightly in last 5 minutes to firm up top
