## Preparation Time
- 17 minutes total (10 minutes pressurization + 5 minutes cooking + 2 minutes release)
- Plus 10 minutes resting time

## Servings
- 4-6 servings (makes about 6 cups cooked rice)

## Ingredients

### For Cooking:
- 2 cups Minute Rice instant brown rice (do NOT rinse)
- 2 cups water
- 1-2 bay leaves
- ½ tsp salt

### For Finishing:
- 1-2 tbsp olive oil (or rice bran oil/sunflower oil)
- ¼ cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped (leaves and tender stems)
- 2 tbsp fresh lime juice (about 1 medium lime)
- 1½ tbsp fresh lemon juice (about ½ lemon)
- ½ tsp salt (adjust to taste)

## Steps

1. **Prep the Instant Pot:** Verify the sealing ring is properly seated in the lid groove, the heating element is clean, and the inner pot exterior is completely dry.

2. **Combine ingredients:** Add 2 cups unrinsed instant brown rice, 2 cups water, 1-2 bay leaves, and ½ teaspoon salt to the inner pot. Give it one quick stir to distribute evenly.

3. **Pressure cook:** Lock the lid and turn the valve to "Sealing" position. Press "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" (NOT the Rice button), ensure it shows "High" pressure, and set timer for 5 minutes.

4. **Wait for pressurization:** Stay nearby until the float valve pops up (about 8-10 minutes). The display will show "On" during pressurization, then count down from 5:00.

5. **Quick release:** When timer beeps, immediately perform quick release. Using a kitchen towel to protect your hand, turn valve to "Venting." Stand back from steam.

6. **Remove and rest:** Once float valve drops (about 30 seconds), open lid tilting away from face. Remove and discard bay leaves. **Critical step**: Let rice rest uncovered for 10 minutes without touching it.

7. **Season and fluff:** After resting, drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over rice and fluff gently with a fork (never a spoon). Add remaining oil, cilantro, lime juice, lemon juice, and finishing salt. Mix with gentle lifting motions.

8. **Adjust and serve:** Taste and adjust citrus or salt as needed. Serve immediately or keep warm.

## Serving Guidelines

- **Burrito bar setup:** Keep warm in Instant Pot on "Keep Warm" setting or transfer to insulated food jar
- **Perfect with:** Black beans, pinto beans, sofritas, corn salsa, tomato salsa, guacamole
- **Temperature safety:** Keep above 140°F for serving; discard if left between 40-140°F for over 2 hours

## Notes

### Critical Success Tips:
- **Never rinse instant rice** - it removes the pre-treatment and ruins texture
- **Always use 1:1 water ratio** for instant rice (not 1:1.25 like regular rice)
- **Must quick release immediately** - natural release creates mushy rice
- **10-minute rest is non-negotiable** - prevents gummy, clumpy texture
- **Use a fork, not spoon** to fluff - preserves grain integrity

### Camping Optimizations:
- Pre-mix citrus juices at home in small bottle (saves water and time)
- Pre-chop cilantro and store in damp paper towel in ziplock
- For altitude above 5,000 feet: add 1 minute cooking time per 1,000 feet elevation
- Keeps warm wrapped in fleece/towel inside cooler for 60-90 minutes

### Make-Ahead Option:
- Cook at home day before, cool completely, refrigerate
- Pack in cooler with ice, keeps 3-4 days below 40°F
- Reheat at camp with 1-2 tsp water per cup, heat to 165°F

### Troubleshooting:
- **Too mushy:** Used too much water or did natural release; spread on plate to dry
- **Too hard:** Add ½ cup water, pressure cook 3 more minutes
- **Burn notice:** Add ½ cup water, scrape bottom, continue cooking
- **Bland flavor:** Use broth instead of water, add lime zest, be generous with seasonings

### Yield Information:
- 2 cups dry instant rice = 6 cups cooked
- Maximum for 4qt Instant Pot: 3 cups dry rice
- Water usage: Only 2 cups (zero for rinsing)
