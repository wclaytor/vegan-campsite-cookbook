## Ingredients
- 4-5 large poblano chiles (or substitute Anaheim/Hatch chiles)
- 2 medium white or yellow onions, sliced into strips
- 2 large tomatoes, cut into strips or chunks
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil (or olive oil)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon Mexican oregano (optional)
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

### For Serving (Quesadilla Style):
- 8 flour tortillas
- 2 cups vegan cheese shreds (or your favorite melty vegan cheese)
- Additional oil for cooking quesadillas

## Steps
### Roast the Poblanos:
1. **Char over fire:** Place poblano chiles directly over campfire flames or on a grill grate over hot coals. Rotate frequently until skin is completely blackened and blistered all over (about 10-12 minutes total).

2. **Steam and peel:** Place charred chiles in a bowl and cover tightly with a plate or plastic wrap. Let steam for 10 minutes - this makes peeling easier.

3. **Peel and slice:** Remove blackened skin with your fingers (it should peel off easily). Remove stems and seeds, then slice into 1/4-inch strips. Don't worry if some char remains - it adds flavor!

### Make the Rajas:
4. **Sauté onions:** Heat oil in a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly golden (about 8-10 minutes).

5. **Add garlic:** Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

6. **Add poblano strips:** Add the roasted poblano strips to the pan. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring gently.

7. **Add tomatoes:** Add tomato strips/chunks and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomatoes are heated through but still hold their shape. Don't overcook - you want some texture.

8. **Finish:** Remove from heat, stir in lime juice and fresh cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning.

### For Quesadillas:
9. **Assemble:** Place rajas and cheese on half of each tortilla, fold over.

10. **Cook:** Heat a clean skillet over medium heat. Cook quesadillas 2-3 minutes per side until golden and cheese is melted.

## Serving Guidelines
- **As quesadilla filling:** Perfect with vegan cheese and avocado
- **Taco filling:** Great in soft tacos with beans and salsa
- **Side dish:** Serve alongside grilled vegetables or campfire proteins
- **Over rice:** Makes a complete meal with cilantro-lime rice

## Notes
- **Heat level:** Poblanos are mild with just a hint of heat - perfect for most palates
- **Char is key:** Don't skip the fire-roasting step - it's what gives authentic flavor
- **Make ahead:** Rajas can be made earlier in the day and reheated
- **Storage:** Keeps in cooler for 3-4 days, great for meal prep
- **Substitutions:** Can use Anaheim, Hatch, or even bell peppers if poblanos unavailable

## Camping Notes
- **Equipment needed:** Tongs for roasting, large skillet or cast iron pan, bowl for steaming
- **Fire management:** Need good flame or very hot coals for proper charring
- **Prep tip:** Chiles can be roasted and peeled at home, then finished at camp
- **Safety:** Use tongs when roasting - poblanos can pop and splatter
- **Storage:** Transport roasted, peeled chiles in cooler if doing prep at home

## Variations
### Rajas con Crema:
- Stir in 1/4 cup vegan sour cream or cashew crema at the end

### Rajas con Elote:
- Add 1 cup corn kernels (fresh, frozen, or grilled) with the tomatoes

### Smoky Chipotle Rajas:
- Add 1-2 minced chipotle chiles in adobo for extra smoke and heat

### Rajas Breakfast:
- Top with scrambled JUST Egg or your DIY egg powder scramble
