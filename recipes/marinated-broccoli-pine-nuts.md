## Preparation Time
- 15 minutes active, 2+ hours marinating

## Servings
- 3-4 servings

## Ingredients
### For the Broccoli:
- 1 large head fresh broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets
- 1/3 cup pine nuts

### For the Tamari-Ginger Dressing:
- 1/4 cup tamari or soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely minced
- 3-4 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil (like sunflower or avocado)

## Steps
1. **Prepare the broccoli:** Wash and cut broccoli into uniform, bite-sized florets. Pat dry with paper towels.

2. **Make the dressing:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together tamari, rice vinegar, sesame oil, minced ginger, minced garlic, honey/maple syrup, and red pepper flakes (if using). Slowly whisk in the neutral oil until well combined.

3. **Marinate the broccoli:** Add the broccoli florets to the bowl with the dressing. Toss thoroughly to coat all pieces evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 8 hours for maximum flavor. Stir occasionally during marinating.

4. **Toast the pine nuts:** Just before serving, heat a dry skillet over medium-low heat. Add pine nuts and toast, stirring frequently, for 3-5 minutes until golden brown and fragrant. Watch carefully as they can burn quickly! Remove from heat immediately.

5. **Finish and serve:** Remove marinated broccoli from refrigerator. Add the warm toasted pine nuts and toss gently to combine. Serve immediately while pine nuts are still warm and crunchy.

## Serving Guidelines
- Serve chilled or at room temperature as a side dish
- Pairs wonderfully with grilled tofu, tempeh, or as part of a summer picnic spread
- Can be served over rice or quinoa for a light main dish

## Notes
- The longer you marinate, the more flavor the broccoli will absorb - overnight is even better!
- Pine nuts can be expensive, so toast only what you need right before serving to maintain crunchiness
- For camping: Prepare the marinated broccoli at home and pack in a cooler. Toast pine nuts over the campfire in a cast iron skillet
- If pine nuts aren't available, try toasted sliced almonds, sunflower seeds, or sesame seeds
- The dressing can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored separately

## Camping Notes
- **Equipment needed:** Large mixing bowl, small skillet for toasting nuts
- **Make-ahead friendly:** Marinate broccoli at home, toast nuts at campsite
- **Storage:** Keeps well in cooler for 2-3 days
- **Campfire cooking:** Toast nuts in cast iron skillet over medium coals
- **No refrigeration option:** Add extra acid (vinegar) and serve within 4 hours if no cooler available
