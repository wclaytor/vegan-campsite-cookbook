## Ingredients
### For the Egg Powder Mix (Make at Home):
- 1 cup chickpea flour (besan)
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
- 1 tablespoon arrowroot powder or cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- Pinch of black salt (kala namak) for eggy flavor (optional but recommended)

### To Make "Eggs" at Camp:
- 1/3 cup egg powder mix
- 1/3 cup water (adjust as needed)
- 1-2 teaspoons oil or vegan butter for cooking

## Steps
### At Home - Make the Powder:
1. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together all powder ingredients until completely combined and no lumps remain.

2. **Store properly:** Transfer to an airtight container or divide into individual serving bags (about 1/3 cup each). Label with instructions and date.

3. **Test batch:** Before your trip, make a small test batch to adjust seasonings if desired.

### At Camp - Make the "Eggs":
4. **Hydrate the mix:** In a bowl, whisk together 1/3 cup powder with 1/3 cup water. Let sit 2-3 minutes to fully hydrate. The mixture should be pourable but not too thin - adjust water as needed.

5. **Heat the pan:** Heat oil or vegan butter in a non-stick skillet or well-seasoned cast iron over medium heat.

6. **Scramble method:** Pour mixture into hot pan. Let sit 30 seconds, then gently scramble with a spatula, pushing from edges to center. Cook 2-3 minutes until set and fluffy.

7. **Omelet method:** Pour mixture into hot pan, let bottom set (about 1 minute), add fillings to one half, fold over and cook 1-2 more minutes.

## Serving Guidelines
- Serve immediately while hot and fluffy
- Great with camping classics: hash browns, toast, avocado, salsa
- Perfect for breakfast burritos, breakfast sandwiches, or fried rice

## Notes
- **Consistency tip:** The batter should coat a spoon but still pour easily - adjust water gradually
- **Flavor boost:** Add fresh herbs, hot sauce, or nutritional yeast when cooking
- **Storage:** Powder keeps 6+ months in airtight container at room temperature
- **Scaling:** Use 1/3 cup powder + 1/3 cup water per 2-egg serving
- **Black salt magic:** Kala namak gives authentic eggy sulfur flavor - find it at Indian grocery stores
- **Gluten-Free:** If using certified GF ingredients
- **Servings:** Makes enough powder for 8-10 servings (about 16-20 "eggs" worth)

## Camping Notes
- **Equipment needed:** Mixing bowl, whisk or fork, non-stick pan or well-seasoned cast iron
- **Pre-portioning:** Measure powder into individual bags at home for easy camp prep
- **Water source:** Works with any clean water - no need for special liquid
- **Weight advantage:** Much lighter than carrying liquid egg substitutes
- **No refrigeration:** Powder is completely shelf-stable until mixed
- **Cook over:** Medium heat on camp stove or medium coals on campfire
